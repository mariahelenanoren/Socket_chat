# Socket Chat

A chat application built with React, Express and Socket.io.

At the landing page the user gets to enter a username and choose whether to create a new room or join an existing one. When creating a room the user can choose to either have it be open to everyone or make it password protected. All the rooms are listed in the sidebar, if a room is password protected it also has a lock icon. Rooms without active users are automatically removed.

Since the end of the project I have made some adjustments to it, such as list all the users in a room in the sidebar and add an typing indication if a user is in the middle of writing a message. I have also replaced some existing components with components from the Material UI library and restructured the landing page.
